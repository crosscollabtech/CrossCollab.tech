## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Organizations submit a project idea or need**  
   (websites, apps, internal tools, data solutions, etc.)

2. **A GitHub repository is created or linked**  
   With clear goals, issues, and contribution guidelines.

3. **Developers join and collaborate**  
   By picking issues, submitting PRs, and building together.

4. **Impact is delivered**  
   Through usable software that serves people and ministries.
