# CrossCollab

**Code with purpose. Build for the Kingdom.**

CrossCollab is an open, community-driven platform that connects **ministries, NGOs, churches, and missionaries** with **Christian technologists** to build open-source software that serves real needs around the world.

All projects are public, collaborative, and GitHub-first.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Organizations submit a project idea or need**
   - **Simple requests** (no repo): e.g., update donor lists, set up livestreams, configure tools.
   - **Build projects** (with repo): e.g., ministry websites, mobile apps, data pipelines.

2. **A GitHub repository is created or linked for build projects**
   With clear goals, issues, and contribution guidelines.

3. **Developers join and collaborate**
   By picking issues, submitting PRs, and building together.

4. **Impact is delivered**
   Through usable software or completed service work that serves people and ministries.
